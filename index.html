                    <p>Samlor machu trey is a soup that's popular in many households in Cambodia as it’s not only easy to make but also has a lovely taste. Its ingredients include fish, garlic, lemongrass, celery, tamarind juice, bean sprouts, pineapple and seasoning with sugar, fish sauce, and salt.

                        Many people also add some fresh green herbs and hot chilli pepper on top.

                    <p>Lok Lak is a traditional Khmer dish, which is basically stir-fried beef slices (or pork) in a light brown sauce, and served with rice and/or green salad and pepper sauce. Most restaurants across the county offer this dish but tastes are varied depending on the chefs and regions.

                        The beef or pork slices must first be marinated before cooking so that they are tastier and juicier.

After putting the beef in heated oil with garlic, stir fry until the beef becomes tender. Then add vegetables such as red peppers and onion as well as the kroeung mixture.

                        Kroeung is lemongrass paste which is considered very healthy.

                        It consists of rice noodles topped with green fish gravy and lots of fresh vegetables including cucumbers, green beans, mint leaves, banana blossom and bean sprouts. It’s very similar to the Thai dish that's known as kanom jeen.It really good for healthy  and improved health.

                    <p>Twa ko is a Cambodian sausage made from beef or pork and various spices. Just like any good homemade sausage, the authentic Khmer sausage contains at least 20-25% fat.

                        Some prefer to use pork belly as the main ingredient; it definitely serves the purpose well. Twa ko can be enjoyed on its own in barbecued, grilled or pan-fried style or served with steamed rice and fresh vegetables.

                    <p>In the Khmer diet, rice and freshwater fish play big roles because of the abundance of both. Amok is a national dish, made from fish, coconut milk and curry paste.

                        All the ingredients are mixed together and put in banana leaf cups with coconut cream on top, then steamed. Another common form is amok chouk – snails with curry steamed in their shells. It's best served with a plate of hot, steamed rice.

                <p>The patch of grass that intersects Sihanouk and Norodom Boulevards is home to Phnom Penh's Independence Monument, built to celebrate Cambodia's independence from French colonial rule in 1953. The sandstone structure represents an Angkorian temple, intricately decorated with nagas (multi-headed snakes).

                    As well as commemorating the nation's independence, the monument is now also a memorial to Cambodia's war-dead. Just a short stroll from the monument is the green stretch of Wat Botum Park, where you'll find the Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument, built in 1979 after Vietnamese forces had defeated the Khmer Rouge.</p>

                    <p>The highlight of Phnom Penh is the beautiful Royal Palace - the seat and residence of Cambodia's royal family since the 1860s. The spired-roof pavilions of the complex are an excellent example of classic Khmer architecture.

                        Both the Throne Hall area and the Silver Pagoda - set within manicured gardens - are open to the public for visiting. The Throne Hall was built in 1917, replacing an earlier wooden structure.
                        
                        The Silver Pagoda is famed for being the home of the Emerald Buddha statue and a mammoth 90-kilogram Gold Buddha statue studded with thousands of diamonds. The Silver Pagoda escaped the brutal destruction of the Khmer Rouge reign and so still contains some beautiful artifacts. The interior ceiling mural depicts the Cambodian epic poem, the Reamker, which is based on the story of the Indian Ramayana.</p>

                <p>It was here, in the Khmer Rouge's Security Prison S-21 that some of the regime's worst torture atrocities were carried out. More than 17,000 people passed through these gates between 1975 and 1978, accused of betraying the revolution in some way. Nearly all prisoners brought here were once themselves members of the Khmer Rouge who were turned on during one of the regime's many internal purges.

                    The visiting experience is made ever more visceral by the displayed photographic evidence hanging on the walls of the sparse cells next to empty beds. S-21 was exceedingly well-managed by Comrade Duch (the head of the prison) who made sure that extensive records were kept. As the prison was hastily abandoned when the Vietnamese took Phnom Penh in 1979, the detailed notes and photographs have survived.</p>

                    <p>Phnom Penh is decidedly flat. The only rise in the landscape here is the 27-meter-high hillock that is home to the temple of Wat Phnom. The first religious building on this spot is thought to have been constructed in the 14th century and has been rebuilt several times, with the current main temple sanctuary dating from 1926.

                        This is one of the city's most important Buddhist temples and is often bustling with locals leaving offerings here and praying at the various shrines that surround the main sanctuary.</p>

                <p>Phnom Penh is a riverine town, and one of the most relaxing ways to go sightseeing in the city is to take to the water. There are regular sunset cruise tourist boat departures from the riverfront between 5pm and 7.30pm, which head along the Tonlé Sap and Mekong Rivers, or you can also hire a private boat nearby to head out on the water at any time of the day (you'll want to put your bargaining hat on though, if you'd like to hire a private boat).

                    This is a great way to get away from the bustling motorbike-clogged streets for an hour and soak up the gentler pace of local river life.</p>
